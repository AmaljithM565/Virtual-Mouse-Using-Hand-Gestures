# Virtual-Mouse-Using-Hand-Gestures
A Python-based virtual mouse that uses real-time hand tracking to control mouse movement and perform left-click actions using finger gestures.


# Virtual Mouse Using Hand Gestures

This project implements a simple virtual mouse using hand gestures captured through a webcam.  
The index finger controls mouse movement, and a pinch gesture between the thumb and index finger performs a left-click.

## Features
- Real-time hand tracking
- Mouse movement using index finger
- Left-click using thumb–index pinch
- Gesture debounce to prevent multiple clicks

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- PyAutoGUI
- NumPy

## Controls
- Move Mouse: Index finger
- Left Click: Pinch thumb and index finger
- Exit: Press `q`
